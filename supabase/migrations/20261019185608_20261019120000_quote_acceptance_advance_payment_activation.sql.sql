# Quotation Acceptance, Competing Quote Closure, Advance Payment & Project Activation

## Purpose
Make quotation acceptance server-enforced, atomic, and concurrency-safe; close competing
quotations when one is selected; drive advance payment through a dedicated, idempotent
payment record; and only activate the project after the advance payment is verified by
the payment provider. The frontend no longer decides acceptance or project state.

## 1. New tables
- `quote_advance_payments`
  - One row per advance payment attempt for an accepted quotation.
  - `id` (uuid PK), `quote_id` (uuid FK -> designer_quotes ON DELETE CASCADE),
    `project_id` (uuid FK -> customers ON DELETE CASCADE),
    `designer_id` (uuid FK -> designers),
    `customer_user_id` (uuid) — snapshot of the homeowner at creation time,
    `razorpay_order_id` (text, unique), `razorpay_payment_id` (text, nullable, unique where not null),
    `amount` (numeric, advance amount in rupees, NOT NULL),
    `currency` (text, default 'INR'),
    `status` (text: 'pending' | 'paid' | 'failed' | 'cancelled'; default 'pending'),
    `provider_response` (jsonb, raw verified provider response, nullable),
    `failure_reason` (text, nullable),
    `created_at`, `updated_at`, `paid_at` (timestamptz, nullable).
  - Uniqueness on `razorpay_order_id` makes order creation idempotent per order id.
  - A paid payment cannot be re-opened (enforced in `record_quote_payment`).

## 2. Columns added to existing tables
- `customers.accepted_quote_id` (uuid, nullable, FK -> designer_quotes ON DELETE SET NULL)
  — records which quote was selected for this project.
- `customers.activation_status` (text, default 'quoting')
  — explicit project execution state independent of quotation status:
    'quoting' (no quote accepted yet),
    'awaiting_advance' (quote accepted, advance payment pending),
    'active' (advance verified, project started),
    'on_hold' (payment failure / cancellation recovery in progress),
    'completed' (work finished — existing workflow).
  These coexist with the existing `assignment_status` column, which keeps its values
  ('unassigned', 'assigned', 'completed').

## 3. Configurable advance percentage
- `site_settings` gains two new rows seeded here:
    setting_key = 'advance_payment_percent' -> stored in `video_url` as text ('10')
      (reusing the existing flexible key/value site_settings table; parsed as numeric).
    setting_key = 'advance_payment_min_amount' -> '0' (minimum advance in rupees).
- The acceptance/payment functions read these via a helper `get_advance_payment_config()`
  so the percentage is not hardcoded. Defaults to 10% with a 0 minimum if the rows
  are missing or unparseable.

## 4. New / replaced SECURITY DEFINER functions
- `get_advance_payment_config()` -> TABLE(percent numeric, min_amount numeric, terms text)
  Stable helper reading site_settings.
- `accept_quote(p_quote_id uuid, p_feedback text)` -> TABLE(success boolean, project_id uuid, designer_id uuid, advance_amount numeric, accepted_quote_id uuid)
  - Verifies the caller (`auth.uid()`) owns the project linked to the quote.
  - Locks the project row (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`) to serialize concurrent accepts.
  - Refuses if `customers.accepted_quote_id` is already set (another quote already won).
  - Refuses if the quote is not in a submittable state (`status='sent'` or 'draft'
    treated as live; 'accepted'/'rejected'/'expired' rejected).
  - Marks the selected quote: `status='accepted'`, `customer_accepted=true`,
    `acceptance_date=now()`, computes and stores `confirmation_amount` from the
    configured advance percent.
  - Sets `customers.accepted_quote_id`, `assigned_designer_id`, `assignment_status='assigned'`,
    `activation_status='awaiting_advance'`.
  - Rejects every other *pending* quote on the same project: `status='rejected'`,
    `rejection_reason='ANOTHER_DESIGNER_SELECTED'`, `rejection_comments` records
    which quote won. Prices, timestamps, items, messages, and history are untouched.
  - Closes competing `project_assignments` rows for the same project whose designer
    is not the selected designer: `status='closed'`.
  - Inserts a row in `quote_acceptance_history` for the accepted quote and each
    rejected competing quote.
  - Notifies the selected designer (congratulations) and each competing designer
    (not selected) via `create_notification`.
  - Returns the advance amount so the caller can display it.

- `record_quote_payment(p_quote_id uuid, p_razorpay_order_id text, p_razorpay_payment_id text, p_amount numeric, p_provider_response jsonb DEFAULT NULL)`
  Replaces the previous minimal version. Now:
  - Locks the quote row `FOR UPDATE`.
  - Idempotent: if a `paid` payment already exists for this quote, returns success
    without inserting a duplicate or re-activating the project.
  - If an existing pending payment for the same `razorpay_order_id` exists, it is
    updated to `paid`; otherwise a new `paid` row is inserted. The
    `razorpay_payment_id` uniqueness guarantees a duplicate webhook for a different
    order cannot create a second paid record.
  - Marks the quote `payment_status='verified'`, `razorpay_payment_id` set,
    `confirmation_amount` finalized.
  - Activates the project ONLY here: `customers.activation_status='active'`,
    `assignment_status='assigned'`, `work_begin_date=now()` (only if not already set).
  - Notifies both designer and customer that the advance is verified and the
    project is active.
  - Refuses if the quote is not the project's `accepted_quote_id` (guards against
    paying a losing/closed quote).

- `cancel_quote_acceptance(p_quote_id uuid, p_reason text)` -> TABLE(success boolean, project_id uuid)
  - Caller must own the project.
  - Only allowed while `activation_status` is 'awaiting_advance' (i.e. before
    payment is verified). Once 'active', cancellation requires the existing
    project workflows.
  - Clears `accepted_quote_id`, resets `activation_status='quoting'`,
    `assignment_status='unassigned'`, `assigned_designer_id=NULL`.
  - Marks the previously-accepted quote back to 'sent' (preserving it for
    re-acceptance) and records history. Does NOT auto-restore competing quotes:
    they remain 'rejected' with reason 'ANOTHER_DESIGNER_SELECTED' until the
    homeowner explicitly reopens the project for new quotations through the
    authorized `reopen_project_for_quotes` function.
  - Notifies the affected designer.

- `reopen_project_for_quotes(p_project_id uuid)` -> TABLE(success boolean)
  - Caller must own the project and `activation_status` must be 'quoting'
    (i.e. after a cancellation, or an admin-authorized reopen).
  - Resets previously-rejected competing quotes (reason 'ANOTHER_DESIGNER_SELECTED')
    back to 'sent' so their designers can be reconsidered. Prices and history
    are preserved; a new history row records the reopen.
  - Reopens `project_assignments` rows that were `closed` back to their prior
    pending state only if the designer has no live quote on the project.
  - Notifies the homeowner.

## 5. RLS policies
- `quote_advance_payments`: homeowners can read payments for their own projects;
  designers can read payments for quotes they own; admins can read all. All writes
  go through SECURITY DEFINER functions (no direct insert/update/delete policy for
  authenticated — deny-by-default).
- New `customers` columns are covered by the existing customer read policy and the
  existing update policy (which already blocks updates after acceptance).

## 6. Compatibility notes
- `has_accepted_quote()` is unchanged; it still returns true when any quote has
  `customer_accepted=true AND status='accepted'`, which matches the new flow.
- `get_customer_quotes()` is unchanged; it already withholds designer contact
  details until `status='accepted' AND payment_status='verified'`.
- `reject_quote()` is unchanged and still available for the homeowner's explicit
  per-quote reject action.
- The old `record_quote_payment` signature is preserved (p_amount defaults, new
  optional p_provider_response) so existing callers keep working.

## 7. Indexes
- `quote_advance_payments(quote_id)`
- `quote_advance_payments(project_id)`
- `quote_advance_payments(designer_id)`
- `quote_advance_payments(status)`
- `customers(activation_status)`
- `customers(accepted_quote_id)`
