# Community Projects marketplace

## Plain-English summary
Homeowners can ask to join an ongoing project that a designer is already delivering. The designer approves or rejects each request. On approval, the new homeowner gets their own project and a cloned quotation (same line items, with a 3% community discount). When that homeowner accepts, the earlier homeowners in the chain each earn a 3% referral reward on their own project value, up to 5 homeowners in total.

## New tables
1. `community_projects` - one row per shared source project. Holds the listing switch (`is_open`) and the maximum number of homeowners (`max_participants`, 1 to 5, original included).
2. `community_join_requests` - a homeowner's request to join. Statuses: pending, approved, rejected, accepted. Only one active request per homeowner per community project.
3. `community_participants` - homeowners in the chain. Status is reserved (approved, awaiting acceptance) or confirmed (accepted). Reserved and confirmed rows count toward capacity.
4. `community_referral_rewards` - one row per earlier homeowner per accepted join. Stores the 3% reward amount and its base value. Unique per join and beneficiary, so a reward can never be issued twice.

## Behaviour
- Designers switch listing on or off for projects they are actively delivering (`set_community_listing`).
- Homeowners request to join using one of their own projects (`request_community_join`). The designer is notified in-app and by email.
- Designers approve or reject (`decide_community_join_request`). Approval locks the community row, checks capacity, clones the project and quotation, and reserves the slot. Each decision can happen only once.
- When the cloned quotation is accepted through the existing acceptance flow, a trigger confirms the participant and creates referral rewards for earlier confirmed homeowners.
- Public listing via `get_community_listings` exposes no personal data (no names, emails, phone numbers, or full addresses).

## Security
- RLS enabled on all four tables. Clients get SELECT only, scoped to the owning designer or the homeowner. All writes go through SECURITY DEFINER functions.
- RPCs are restricted: anonymous callers may only use the public listing function. Trigger and internal functions are not callable by clients.

## Notes
- The 3% community discount is applied to the cloned quotation's pre-tax value (subtotal minus existing discount). Tax is recalculated at the existing tax rate.
- Referral rewards are recorded as credits. They do not change any accepted or paid quotation.
